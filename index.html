      <p>Long have you searched for which programming language to begin learning. Some have said Python. Others say HTML.</p>
      <p>I'm here to tell you, don't listen to them! LISTEN TO ME!!</p>
      <p>Through state of the art technology¹, years of neurological research², and about 8 hours of programming, I have come up with a universal solution to this daunting question.</p>
      <p>Click the button below to fill out a short questionnaire that will answer all of your questions. Or in this case, one. I take no responsibility for the hours of googling that will happen as a result of your chosen path. </p>
