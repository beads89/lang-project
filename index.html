      <hr>
      <p>Long have you searched for which programming language to begin learning. Some have said Python. Others say HTML. I'm here to tell you, don't listen to them!</p>
      <h5><strong>LISTEN TO ME!!</strong></h5>
      <p>Through state of the art technology¹, years of neurological research¹, and about 8 hours of programming, I have come up with a universal solution to this daunting question.</p>
      <p>Click the button below to fill out a short questionnaire that will answer all of your questions. Or in this case, one. I take no responsibility for the hours of googling that will happen as a result of your chosen path. </p>

      <br>
      <p>Looks like you're stuck with the same language I am. Not that that's a bad thing! C# was designed by Microsoft, so you know it's going to be popular. You're in for a lot of fun. If you need any help, I can write you an invoice in advanced.</p>

    <div id="python">
      <h3 class="center-text">Python</h3>
      <img src="img/python3.png" alt="python logo" class="center-pic">
      <p>You Slytherin, you. Besides having a very cute logo, Python is a relatively easy to learn, hard to master language. Maybe Snape has a potion that'll make you a genius at it in no time.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="javascript">
      <h3 class="center-text">JavaScript</h3>
      <img src="img/javascript2.png" alt="javascript logo" class="center-pic">
      <p><em>"If you like piña coladas"...</em> No? Oh, right, this is JavaScript. One of the most powerful and flexible coding languages you'll get your hands on. Designed by a lad over at Netscape(if you even remember who are they), JavaScript is used in almost every website you visit... including this one!! You can't go wrong with being a JavaScript guru.</p>

    <div id="swift">
      <h3 class="center-text">Swift</h3>
      <img src="img/swift3.png" alt="swift logo" class="center-pic">
      <p>Don't be fooled by Swift's age compared to the competition, this language was written by industry giant Apple Inc. and has quickly become a technological behemoth. Mainly used for building apps in iOS and similar Apple products, Swift is the new kid on the block, the sidewalk, your driveway, frontdoor, garage, and anywhere you can yell, "Hey Siri!", and get a response. Love Apple? Give this one a go!</p>
